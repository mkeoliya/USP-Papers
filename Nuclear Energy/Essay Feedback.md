Your introduction was short. You could have contextualised the problem of energy before introducing the specific question you wanted to address. Also, you could have moved Section III to the introduction. You didn’t consider oil as a source of energy. However, you did investigate sustainability as a criteria. The structure of your argument was clear and logical. Your analysis was precise, perhaps sometimes a bit complicated to follow. You did perform tests, used models, discussed ALS, and quantified uncertainties, showing an excellent understanding of QR. Remember that you should always start by showing your data, then describing it, and finally analysing it. It would have been interesting to look at other potential hazards in your section on environmental impact, instead of solely focusing on GHG. The section on Public Safety was less convincing as you considered YOLL, a quantity that you can’t directly measured and that is built on many hidden choices beyond your control. Overall, your essay was very good. You got an 79/100. The best mark of the class was 82/100.

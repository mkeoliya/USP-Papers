## PERSONAL STATEMENT
Write a personal statement of 100-150 words addressing the following questions: 
What is an "engaged person"? Are you one? 
Please note that your interviewers, should you be shortlisted to meet with them, will read and may invite you to further develop this answer.

An engaged person is a paragon of the juggling arts, with  the true ability to switch between laser-focused tunnel vision and the bigger picture, between intricate details of an issue and a wider motivation to know it. Far from a mere list of qualities, his character is not one of running in the grooves of personality traits, and he is the man who prefers to listen than to hear, to solve problems and not numericals and to think and act critically rather than passively consuming information.

In the same vein, I am an engaged person affianced to my Indianness, and I engage and wrestle with this identity in everything I do. This grand overflow of views, complexity, colors, perspectives and chaotic ladders always pushes me to ask “is there more?” whenever I read a news article or write a block of code or converse with family. There’s always more to juggle.

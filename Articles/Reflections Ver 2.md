## Reflections at 22 College Ave East

_Welcome on board_.

It’s been a year since we boarded the express shuttle to NUS College. Like a D1 at 9:30am, we’ve tried to somehow stay upright, find space to breathe, cling onto handles, avoid stepping on other people’s feet, and retain the contents of the morning’s breakfast. We’ve slightly crashed into each other as the bus does the notorious UTurn@UTown. And now we’re ready to cross the UTown Causeway into the world of the unknown. And you stop and think: _what the fuck am I doing here?_

That’s a question every USP student asks themselves when they open their transcript. We often reflect on our decision to join the program. We care so much about reflection that we engage in a non SU-able painfest called USR even as we _leave_ the program.

 And that’s completely understandable. After hundreds of hours of reading for class, 2359 submission anxieties, and one WCT, what student in their right mind wouldn’t ask: _Why am I doing USP? What am I gaining or losing? Will this help me in the long run? What am I doing with my life? Can I press adjacent buttons in the lift if I’m tired?_

We haven’t had any time for reflection in the last year. Let’s talk about the transition to NUSC, and concerns and hopes for NUSC as we move forward. Strap in. It’s going to be a long ride.

**Death**

So first off, _death_. USP died a quiet death on 30th June, with the end of Prof Kang’s tenure. There was no formal announcement of USP’s demise, no obituary and no funeral. But perhaps we don’t _need_ to have a funeral, a friend tells me. Won’t USP live on in NUSC? Yes, USP’s culture and students will transition to NUSC. But that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t celebrate the 21 years of USP, and cherish what past directors, faculty and students have built over time[[1]](#_msocom_1) .

Because of the hectic chaos that was last year, we haven’t had proper discussions with USP students, faculty and alumni to talk about _how_ USP was like as a programme, to probe its strengths and weaknesses, or its scope for improvement[1]. In the face of such trifling disregard for the spirit of reflection, I wonder how superficial next semester’s USR will feel like for my classmates in Year 4.

Even though I feel that the NUSC admin has worked constructively with USP students on most issues, the admin has sometimes prioritized public relations over USP’s community. Here’s an example. The old USP decorations and paraphernalia in the Learn Lobes (like the wonderfully blue timeline) have already been replaced with a whitewashed wall, but crucial information like NUSC modules and staff emails continue to be hosted on USP’s official website.

On a sentimental level, USP students weren’t given a chance to mourn for, or grieve for USP. Several alumni and professors shared with me that they felt that the NUSC admin toed a line of “strategic ambiguity” when it came to defining NUSC’s culture. That ambiguity meant we didn’t even know how much to grieve for when the “merger” was first announced. If, after all, NUSC was going to be a simple renaming of USP, then we wouldn’t have much to grieve for, beyond the loss of the _ketupat logo_. The “strategic ambiguity” is understandable since the admin want freshmen to shape NUSC culture too. But Y2/Y3/Y4 have a stake in this too.

I feel there’s been a rush to symbolically delete USP in theory, but in practice rely on its dead skeleton to flesh out NUSC.

**NOW!**

Since late last year, USP students had been planning for a Freshmen Orientation Programme (FOP). They invested a significant amount of time and effort into it. Several students committed their whole summer for FOP. Then in January, the Deanery stated that FOP would be admin-run, and not run by students, as it usually is. The reasoning was understandable: they didn’t want USP to imprint its culture on the freshmen. In other words, the Deanery wanted a fresh start.

Ideally, the Deanery should’ve understood that USP is not a cultural monolith that indoctrinates freshmen during FOP. At USP, orientation has always been about helping freshmen have fun and adjust to university life, and make them feel like they’re in a welcoming space. Each cohort of USP students develops its “fresh start”, its own cultural vibe, through the IGs, GUIs and general banter that they start or sustain. USP gets a fresh start every year.

Nevertheless, even if the Deanery wanted to (understandably) shepherd the first batch of NUSC freshmen via an admin-run FOP, they could’ve still engaged with students constructively by figuring out together what a “fresh start” could best look like. Like I said earlier, the FOP Comm wasn’t intending to brainwash freshmen; they just wanted them to have a great start to uni.

Instead, the Deanery’s late decision to make FOP admin-run left student OGLs in the lurch, and many students scrambled to find internships for the summer instead. They weren’t needed. Until they were, in late March. It turns out that students _are_ needed for orientation. Except that now, Orientation Group Leaders (OGLs) became “student facilitators” and safety officers, and impromptu house events became mandated ‘evening conversations,’ much to the dismay of all House Committees. One member quipped that they felt like “saikang warriors” doing the Deanery’s bidding.

One saddening incident in particular was the hiring of an external vendor to run one of the days for NOW!. The words “external” and “vendor” send a corporate-culture-induced shiver up my spine. But nonetheless, the vendor planned an “Amazing Race” around UTown, with station games and stalls around UTown. But they did a pretty bad job at it: stations weren’t set up on time, some were abandoned, most were mundane. Nevertheless, seniors tried to salvage the affair by either running their own stalls, or taking the freshmen elsewhere to chill and actually have fun. “They’re just throwing money at the problem,” a senior exclaimed to me. The freshmen weren’t pumped either: one of the FOPD candidates recounted his negative experiences during NOW! as well.

What gets my goat is that some of the staff hired by the external vendor were students from other RCs in UTown.  So much for a fresh start.

The admin staff on the ground, such as Cheryl and Beverly, worked tirelessly to make NOW! a success. Their contributions were superb; but the Deanery didn’t do particularly well. The Dean forgetting to thank the FOP team during the closing of NOW! was not a good sign either.

We care about reflection, and rightly so. It makes us ask interesting questions about _ourselves_. It’s a refreshing change to redirect inquiry away from the _outside world_ and towards the self. Take Prof Bart’s _Technologies of the Self_ to know more.

_Au revoir_, USP. Hello, NUSC.

PS: This article’s title is inspired by _The Reflections at Bukit Chandu_, and by Prof Quek’s critique of _it._ as a hollow and unrealistic portrayal of the Malay community’s heritage. The fact that both NUS College and Singapore have a troubled relationship with their past is purely a coincidence.

PPS: This article uses terms such as “orientation” and “freshmen” in lieu of “onboarding” and “first-year” students. I can see why some students might feel that the older words aren’t desirable. However, based on my experience at USP, the usage of the older words is justified because we did not (by and large) have a toxic hierarchy during orientation, and did not intend for words such as “freshmen” to be exclusionary. We shouldn’t parachute external contexts into USP (and now NUSC).
